# Exercises --------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4.1 ---------

# Using the `DHSREGNA` variable in our DHS cluster point data, identify the
# 5 KE regions with the most DHS clusters

# 4.2 ---------

# Using the `DHSREGEN` variable in our Kenya administrative boundaries file,
# identify the 5 KE regions with the largest area-to-perimeter ratio

# Bonus: make a map where each administrative region is colored by its
# area-to-perimeter ratio. (Hint: you may need to convert your calculated
# area-to-perimeter to a number with `as.numeric()`)

# 4.3 ---------

# Find the DHS cluster that is furthest from the Kenyan national border
#
# You will need to use the dissolved national border file from the demo to
# do so. I've converted it from a polygon to a linestring object for you.
#
# Bonus: make a map where each DHS cluster point is colored by its distance
# to the national border

ke_national_border <- st_union(ke_borders)
ke_borders_lines <- st_cast(ke_national_border, to = "MULTILINESTRING")

# 4.4 ----------

# Identify the 5 Kenya administrative regions with the highest density
# of DHS clusters. That is, which regions have the most clusters per unit
# of area? Use the `DHSREGEN` variable in the boundary file to identify
# regions.
#
# Hint: this will require joining cluster points with the administrative
# boundary file as shown in the demo.
